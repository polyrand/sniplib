# SnipLib ‚ö°Ô∏è
> Fast and simple organizer for your code snippets.

The main purpose of this script is having a fast ‚ö°Ô∏è and easy way to search
through your code snippets, mixing the power of
[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) and
[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

## Installation


**Requirements:**
* [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
* Optional for fancier preview (any of the following):
  * [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
  * [highlight](https://github.com/felixfbecker/cli-highlight)
  * [coderay](https://github.com/rubychan/coderay)
  * [rougify](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge)

This utility relies on `pbcopy` or `xclip`, so if you are not using macOS install xclip with `sudo apt-get install -y xclip`:


macOS & linux:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rickaa/sniplib.git
chmod +x sniplib.sh
./sniplib.sh [SNIPPETS FOLDER] [SEARCH QUERY - optional]
```

**Recommended usage:**

Add an alias to your `.bashrc` (or whatever you use) to launch the script with your snippets folder as an argument (or
you can use mine üòä):

```bash
#sniplib (with custom folder)
alias snip='~/Projects/sniplib/sniplib.sh ~/Projects/sniplib/snips'
```

## Usage example

See it in action (first copying to clipboard then editing the snippet):

If you want to sort alphabetically the tags in all the snippets, run:

```bash
chmod +x sort_tags.py
./sort_tags.py
```
