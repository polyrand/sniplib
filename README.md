# SnipLib ‚ö°Ô∏è
> Fast and simple organizer for your code snippets.

The main purpose of this script is having a fast ‚ö°Ô∏è and easy way to search
through your code snippets, mixing the power of
[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) and
[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

## Why

The amount of tools to keep notes / snippets is huge. I created sniplib for the
following reasons:

* No lock-in, files are just text and you can keep them however you want.
* Interactive finding + grepping. Since ripgrep is very fast, I can afford
    running it every time I type something so that I can have **content
    grepping** + **fuzzy file matching**.
* No need to install any app.

Apart from that, I am constantly updating my snippets. Every time I find myself googling the same thing more than twice I put it in a snippet, so next time I can save some time and I know where I can find and answer that works.

## Installation

**Requirements:**
* [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
* Optional for fancier preview (any of the following):
  * [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
  * [highlight](https://github.com/felixfbecker/cli-highlight)
  * [coderay](https://github.com/rubychan/coderay)
  * [rougify](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge)

This utility relies on `pbcopy` or `xclip`, so if you are not using macOS install xclip with `sudo apt-get install -y xclip`:


macOS & linux:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/polyrand/sniplib.git
chmod +x sniplib.sh
./sniplib.sh [SNIPPETS FOLDER] [SEARCH QUERY - optional]
```

**Recommended usage:**

Add an alias to your `.bashrc` (or whatever you use) to launch the script with your snippets folder as an argument (or
you can use mine üòä):

```bash
#sniplib (with custom folder)
alias snip='~/Projects/sniplib/sniplib.sh ~/Projects/sniplib/snips'
```

(*Note:* `~/Projects/sniplib/sniplib.sh` would be where you download the script and `~/Projects/sniplib/snips` would be you snippets/notes folder).

## Usage example

See it in action (first copying to clipboard then editing the snippet):

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/FKI3CtC094xsBP1Eks9frPmDw.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/FKI3CtC094xsBP1Eks9frPmDw)

If you want to sort alphabetically the tags in all the snippets, run:

```bash
chmod +x sort_tags.py
./sort_tags.py
```

## Notice

If you find a snippet without the appropiate source inside please let me know so that I can give credit to its author.
